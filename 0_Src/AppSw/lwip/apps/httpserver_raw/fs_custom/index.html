  <h1>AURIX Application Kit TC297TF with lwIP TCP/IP Stack</h1>
  <p>

    The web page you are watching was served by a simple web
    server running on top of the lightweight TCP/IP stack <a
    href="http://www.sics.se/~adam/lwip/">lwIP</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    lwIP is an open source implementation of the TCP/IP
    protocol suite that was originally written by <a
    href="http://www.sics.se/~adam/lwip/">Adam Dunkels
    of the Swedish Institute of Computer Science</a> but now is
    being actively developed by a team of developers
    distributed world-wide. Since it's release, lwIP has
    spurred a lot of interest and has been ported to several
    platforms and operating systems. lwIP can be used either
    with or without an underlying OS.
